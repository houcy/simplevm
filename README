SimpleVM was written for the purpose of demonstrating some
basic techniques in implementing simple virtual machines.
It stemmed from my time spent in a programming languages course
and the professor asked me to teach a couple classes on basic
virtual machines.

This code isn't intended to be used for production systems however
with some more work, its feasible that it could be used as such. It
has a couple major weaknesses right now, mainly lack of any way to
allocate memory and/or garbage collection with objects as well as
a linear search style for looking up line numbers for jump labels.
These are largely due to lack of time to fix these deficiencies.
